# You will be given two strings a and b consisting of lower case letters, but a will have at most one asterix character. The asterix (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase letters. No other character of string a can be replaced. If it is possible to replace the asterix in a to obtain string b, then string b matches the pattern.
