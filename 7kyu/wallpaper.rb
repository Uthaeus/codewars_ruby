# John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.

# John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

# Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

# #Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"



def wallpaper(l, w, h)
    # your code
    output = {
      '10': 'ten', 
      '11': 'eleven',
      '12': 'twelve',
      '13': 'thirteen',
      '14': 'fourteen', 
      '15': 'fifteen',
      '16': 'sixteen',
      '17': 'seventeen',
      '18': 'eighteen',
      '19': 'nineteen',
      '20': 'twenty'
    }
    surface_area = (2 * (l * h)) + (2 * (w * h))
    total = surface_area + (surface_area * 0.15)

    roll = 5.2

    result = ((total / roll).ceil).to_s  
    output[result.to_sym]
end



p wallpaper(7.8, 2.9, 3.29) #, "sixteen"
p wallpaper(6.3, 5.8, 3.13) #, "seventeen"
