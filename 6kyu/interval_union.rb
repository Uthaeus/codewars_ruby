# Write a function interval_insert which takes as input

# a list myl of disjoint closed intervals with integer endpoints, sorted by increasing order of left endpoints
# an interval interval
# and returns the union of interval with the intervals in myl, as an array of disjoint closed intervals.

    #your code here
end



p interval_insert([[1, 2]], [3, 4]) #, [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
