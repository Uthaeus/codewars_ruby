# You certainly can tell which is the larger number between 210 and 215.

# But what about, say, 210 and 310? You know this one too.

# Things tend to get a bit more complicated with both different bases and exponents: which is larger between 39 and 56?

# Well, by now you have surely guessed that you have to build a function to compare powers, returning -1 if the first member is larger, 0 if they are equal, 1 otherwise; powers to compare will be provided in the [base, exponent] format:



def compare_powers(n1,n2)
  #your code here
end



p compare_powers([2,10],[3,10]) #,1
