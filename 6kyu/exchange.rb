# It's time for some array exchange! The objective is simple: To exchange between two arrays but with one catch; the content of the exchanged array must be reversed.


class Array
    def exchange_with!(other_array)
        
    end
end



room_a = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"]
room_b = ["a", "b", "c"]

room_a.exchange_with!(room_b)
